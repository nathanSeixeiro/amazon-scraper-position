# Objective:

Develop a script to determine the search position of a specific product on Amazon based on its ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) and a keyword.

## Task Requirements:

### Backend (Node.js es6):

- Set up a basic JavaScript project with necessary dependencies for server setup and web scraping.
- Create a script to retrieve Amazon search results for a specific keyword. - - - Please ensure that pagination is implemented for a maximum of 5 pages.
- Use appropriate web scraping techniques to parse the HTML content.
- Extract and return the position of a product identified by its ASIN in the search results.

### Frontend (HTML, CSS/Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript):

- Design a simple and user-friendly webpage using HTML and Bootstrap 5 or pure CSS for styling.
- Incorporate an input field for the ASIN and another for the search keyword.
- Include a button to initiate the scraping process.
- Utilize JavaScript to make an AJAX call to your backend script when the button is clicked.
- Display the position of the specified product in the search results on the page.

### Documentation:

- Include comments in your code to explain your logic and methodologies.
- Prepare a README.md file detailing setup and execution instructions.

### Considerations:

- Handle errors effectively on both the backend and frontend.
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for running the application.
